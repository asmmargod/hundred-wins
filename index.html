          Don't hit the cross until you read the instructions, you nincompoop!

        <p class="fluff">
          In order to win the game you must reach 100 points. You roll a dice
          and the score adds up in the current box. If you roll ONE your current
          score resets, you lose the points you rolled so far during your turn
          and the other player gets to roll the dice. In order to keep the score
          you accumulated during your turn you need to press hold, it then adds
          your current score and then the other player rolls the dice. Reminder,
          every time one is rolled a player loses their points accumulated
          during their turn and the other player gets to roll the dice.
        </p>

          I know the instructions suck, hopefully you can figure it out on your
          own ðŸ˜œ
